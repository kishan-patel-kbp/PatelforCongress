          <h2>Why vote for me?</h2>
          <p class="intro">As a data scientist at heart, I belive in data-driven and evidenced
            based policy making. For far too long our elected officials have passed laws
            that fail to ignore the reality of our society. We have place fear and emotion
            over facts and data. I seek to change that by passing and voting for laws that
            have been empirically studied and analyzed. As a first-generation American from rural America,
            I understand the hardships everyday Americans face. I seek to not divide us, but instead,
            bring heart and vison to a broken political arena.</p>

            <h3>Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
            <p>There is no "equal justice under the law." The underprivileged and people of
            color have been silenced by a system so unequal and unjust that it requires institutional
          reform. That starts with appointing federal and district court judges who are reperesentative of the people
        not the elite and powerful. The prison-industrial complex profits off of the incarcerated, and this can no longer
      be tolerated. We must change our mindset, and rehabilitate prisoners to provide them with second chances.</p>

            <h3>Health Care Reform</h3>
            <p>I believe in attaining universal coverage, but the smartest way to
            get there is through a Medicare public option. Under this policy every American
          would automatically be enrolled in Medicare, but you could choose to opt out.
        This ensures that everyone has coverage while minimizing the federal tax burden.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change Policy</h3>
            <p>Our politicians have failed to realize the urgency and seriousness of climate change.
            This issue has divided Americans, pitting jobs vs. environmental regulation. However, I would
          argue that these issues are intertwined. We can achieve net zero emissions, without the complete
        elimination of energy sector jobs. I propose incentivizing fossil fuel companies with tax credits,
      in order to transition their business model away from fossil fuels. This ensures that the most powerful
    corporations are part of the conversation, not the enemy. Secondly, I propose developing state of the art
  nuclear power plants in order to meet our energy needs while at the same time providing clean and safe energy.</p>
